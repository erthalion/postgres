/*
 * As of PostgreSQL 9.3, we normally allocate only a very small amount of
 * System V shared memory, and only for the purposes of providing an
 * interlock to protect the data directory.  The real shared memory block
 * is allocated using mmap().  This works around the problem that many
 * systems have very low limits on the amount of System V shared memory
 * that can be allocated.  Even a limit of a few megabytes will be enough
 * to run many copies of PostgreSQL without needing to adjust system settings.
 *
 * We assume that no one will attempt to run PostgreSQL 9.3 or later on
 * systems that are ancient enough that anonymous shared memory is not
 * supported, such as pre-2.4 versions of Linux.  If that turns out to be
 * false, we might need to add compile and/or run-time tests here and do this
 * only if the running kernel supports it.
 *
 * However, we must always disable this logic in the EXEC_BACKEND case, and
 * fall back to the old method of allocating the entire segment using System V
 * shared memory, because there's no way to attach an anonymous mmap'd segment
 * to a process after exec().  Since EXEC_BACKEND is intended only for
 * developer use, this shouldn't be a big problem.  Because of this, we do
 * not worry about supporting anonymous shmem in the EXEC_BACKEND cases below.
 *
 * As of PostgreSQL 12, we regained the ability to use a large System V shared
 * memory region even in non-EXEC_BACKEND builds, if shared_memory_type is set
 * to sysv (though this is not the default).

 * anything else, yet do not count against memory limits). Having the reserved
 * space, we allocate out of it actual chunks of shared memory as usual,
 * updating a pointer to the current available reserved space for the next
 * allocation with the gap between segments in mind.

 *
 * The reserved space pointer is calculated to slice up the total reserved
 * space into fixed fractions of address space for each segment, as specified

 *         |                   |
 *     New NBuffers       Old NBuffers
 *
 * In this case the backend is not yet ready to receive a signal from
 * EmitProcSignalBarrier, and will be ignored. The same happens if ProcSignal
 * is initialized even later, after the resizing was finished.
 *
 * To address resulting inconsistency, postmaster broadcasts the current
 * NBuffers value via shared memory. Every new backend has to verify this value
 * before it will access the buffer pool: if it differs from its own value,
 * this indicates a shared memory resize has happened and the backend has to
