* design a new discard worker

* recreate undo requests after recovery
** need to annotate "noop" records with commit/abort info - use xact rmgr?

** otherwise after a subxact aborts, only end location is set

* code for modifying pages needs cleanup and centralization
** Andres thinks "don't overrun page" should be centralized in one place
